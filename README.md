# Flashzilla
A flashcard application to enable learning through flashcards on a phone. The project is built with SwiftUI

### Features are:
* Various Gesture support in SwiftUI
* `Core Haptics` & `Timer` implementations
* Reading notifications from `NotificationCenter`
* Supporting specific accessibility needs with SwiftUI

#### TODO:
* Make a haptic feedback for when the timer runs out.
* Add a setting that can be from the user whether or not they want to reuse the card and try again.
* If you drag a card to the right but not far enough to remove it, then release, you see it turn red as it slides back to the center. Why does this happen and how can you fix it?
